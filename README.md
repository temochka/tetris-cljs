# Tetris in ClojureScript

![](http://img.temochka.com/tetris-cljs.png)

My personal take on Tetris in ClojureScript.
It’s aimed to be very lightweight, so if you’re interested in full-powered Tetris in ClojureScript, then take a look at an amazing project called [t3tr0s](https://github.com/imalooney/t3tr0s).
Otherwise this implementation may still give you an idea of how awesome ClojureScript is and why you will never want to look back at Javascript once you try it.
